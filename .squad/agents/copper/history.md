# Copper — History

## Project Context

**Project:** Umbraco.Prism — Multi-tenancy package for Umbraco v17+
- Dynamic branding with CSS variable overrides
- Stateless OIDC identity (tenant-specific ClientId/Authority per request)
- Produce Mobile feature: Download native-shell Capacitor app starters with tenant settings
- **Stack:** .NET 10.0.x, Node.js 22.17.1, Web Components, Playwright, XUnit tests

**User:** Jonny Muir

## Security Context

- Prism is multi-tenant and security-critical by design.
- User directive: prioritize confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Zero tolerance objective: no cross-tenant authentication leakage and no cross-tenant data leakage.
- OAuth must be implemented with tenant-safe boundaries; avoid single-tenancy caching assumptions common in generic MSAL-style designs.

## Learnings

- Entra-first authorization model migration is underway (#4 with child issues #8, #9, #10).
- OIDC and token refresh paths recently hardened (#2, #3) and require ongoing isolation-focused verification.
- Security reviews should include cache keying, token claim scoping, fallback behavior, and failure-mode isolation.
